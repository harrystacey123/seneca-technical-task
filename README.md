# Harry Stacey's technical task for Seneca Learning. #

Overall I am pleased with what I’ve produced. I thought about implementing an npm package to try get a smooth transition between selecting answer options but decided against it, as I could not find an applicable one to use.

If I had more time I would include more shades of orange/yellow to the backgrounds as the user progresses closer to the correct answer. I have two background shades: orange for incorrect, and blue for correct. 

I added code to try lock the solution once the correct answer was reached, but I was making an infinite loop and so removed it. Unfortunately the solution does not lock. 

As I say I’m pleased overall with it, and I hope you are too!
